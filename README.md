Taxi Kaggle Competition

This kaggle competition had an emphasis on feature engineering. I would like to come back to this and work on it more in a later date. I didn't really have enough time to work on this the way I would want to. I had many ideas for features but didn't have the time to figure out how to impliment them.

Then, when I was trainig my model I kept having memory issues because the data was too large on my machine to do something like XGboost or Random Forest. I ended up using Linear Regression. I got a terrible score but at least it made it all the way through the data without crashing my computer. 

I would like to come back to this in the future when I have better resources and more time to fiddle around with it. It's a really cool dataset though.
